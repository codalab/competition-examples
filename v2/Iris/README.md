### Codalab V2 competition bundle

This is a collection of files containing the `competition.yaml` which defines different aspects and attributes of the competition, the logo, the html pages documenting the competition, and the data associated with it. The goal is to provide a ready-to-use template for competition creation on [Codalab V2](https://github.com/codalab/competitions-v2).

This example is a classification task. The challenge can handle result submissions and code submissions.
