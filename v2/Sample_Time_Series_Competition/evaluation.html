<h1>Evaluation</h1> 

<p>During the <strong>development phase</strong>,
the participants must submit code to predict the next 7 frames (days) of the
data sequence, given past frames. We compute the average
<strong>MSE</strong> (root mean square error) over all predictions
made for each frame, averaged over all predicted
frames. The average is taken only over designated variables.</p> 

<h1>Instructions</h1> 

<p>To make entries, go
to the "Participate" tab. You must be a Codalab user to participate and
you must accept the Terms and Conditions of the challenge and the rules. The rules include all instructions found in this website.</p> 

<p>Under
the "Participate" tab, you will be able to download "public" data
to familiarize yourself with the task, a starting kit, including a sample
submission. The interface must be respected to create successful submissions.
The class to be modified is called "model.py". 
Code execution time is limited on Codalab to <b>ten minutes</b> for the whole
dataset (N steps, each step corresponding to predicting the next 7 frames) in both phases.

<p>To create a submission, just zip the script "model.py" together with the metadata file
(which indicates that you are making a code submission). IMPORTANT: zip code without directories.</p> 


<p> There are 2 phases:</p> 

<ul> <li><strong>Phase 1: Development phase. </strong> 
Your code received on our server will see in the input directory several subdirectories:
<pre>
training/
evaluation/
</pre>
The data in training/training0.csv and training/training1.csv etc. can be used for training. The data
in evaluation/evaluation0.csv, evaluation/evaluation1.csv etc. will be used for adaptation and testing. 
The script ingestion.py will run your code. It will make the training data and part of the evaluation data
available to your both your "train" and "predict" methods, progressively. Your predict method will have to forecast
the next 7 frames.
<br>
Let us call X matrix concatenating the training and evaluation data ordered by time index.
The expected sequence of training data and predictions will be:
<pre>
time step : frames provided   frames predicted
1	
.
.
.
Ntr         1:Ntr             Ntr+1:Ntr+7 
Ntr+1		1:Ntr+1 		  Ntr+2:Ntr+8
Ntr+2
Ntr+3
.
.
.
Ntr+Neval-2 1:Ntr+Neval-2     Ntr+Neval-1:Ntr+Neval
Ntr+Neval-1 1:Ntr+Neval-1     Ntr+Neval 
</pre>

<br> 
<br>The performance of your LAST code submission you make will be displayed on the
leaderboard.</li> 

<li><strong>Phase 2: Final evaluation phase.</strong> The setting will be similar.

Your last submission of phase 1 will be
automatically forwarded, so you do not need to do anything. However, if you wish, you may also make ONE submission during the final evaluation phase.
But beware, this is a blind test. You will not get any feedback. If your submitted code fails, you will not get another chance.
Your code will see the following subdirectories:
<pre>
training/
		training0.csv
		training1.csv
		training2.csv
		etc.
evaluation/
		evaluation0.csv
		evaluation1.csv
		etc.
</pre>
Similarly to the previous phase, data in the training/ sub-directories is for training and data in 
the evaluation/ directory for adaptation and testing.
 Your performance on the test set will appear on
the leaderboard when the organizers finish checking the
submissions.</li> </ul>
