<h2 style="text-align: center;">Automated Weakly Supervised Learning</h2>
<div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Asian Conference on Machine Learning (<a href="http://www.acml-conf.org/2019/">ACML</a>)</strong> 2019 will be held in WINC AICHI, Nagoya, Japan&nbsp;from November 17 to 19, 2019. <strong>AutoWSL</strong>&nbsp;is one of the competitions in main conference<strong>&nbsp;</strong>provided by <strong>4Paradigm</strong>,<strong> ChaLearn,</strong>&nbsp;<strong>RIKEN and Microsft&nbsp;</strong>and co-organized with <a href="https://wsl-workshop.github.io">WSL-workshop@ACML 2019</a>.</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">UC terminates subscriptions with world&rsquo;s largest scientific publisher in the push for open access to publicly funded research, since &ldquo;Knowledge should not be accessible only to those who can pay,&rdquo; said Robert May, chair of UC&rsquo;s faculty Academic Senate. Similarly, machine learning should not be accessible only to those who can pay. Specifically, modern machine learning is migrating to the era of complex models (e.g., deep neural networks), which require a plethora of well-annotated data. Large companies have enough money to collect well-annotated data. However, for startups or non-profit organizations, such data is barely acquirable due to the cost of labeling data (e.g., by crowd-sourcing platforms). Besides, well-annotated may not exist due to the natural scarcity in the given domain (e.g., Alzheimer's disease&nbsp;or earthquake prediction). Weakly-supervised learning (WSL) is defined as the collection of machine learning problem settings and algorithms that share the same goals as supervised learning but can only access to less supervised information than supervised learning. The above facts and practical issues motivate us to research and pay attention to weakly-supervised learning (WSL) since WSL does not require such a massive amount of annotated data. What's more, traditional WSL methods have too many hyperparameters to tune depending on the problems, which requires too much human effort to deploy a WSL method successfully.&nbsp;</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: left;">Here, we propose the first AutoWSL competition which aims at proposing automated solutions for WSL-related tasks. This challenge is restricted to binary classification problems, which come from different application domains. 3 practice datasets are provided to the participants for developing AutoWSL solutions. Afterward, solutions will be evaluated with 18 unseen feedback and final private datasets without human intervention. The results of these datasets determine the final ranking.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br />In AutoWSL competition, we will focus on three popular tasks in WSL, i.e., semi-supervised learning (some samples are unlabeled), positive unlabeled learning (samples are only positive or unlabeled, no negative samples), and learning from noisy labels (all samples are labeled, but some labels can be wrong). These are three disjoint tasks, and they will NOT simultaneously appear in a single data set. There will be auxiliary information helping participants identify which task they need to perform on each data set.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br />AutoWSL will pose new challenges to the participants, as listed below:</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">- How to automatically deal with various kinds of WSL tasks?</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">- How to automatically extract useful features for different tasks?</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">- How to automatically handle different amounts of supervised information?</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">- How to automatically design effective learning models to deal with various structured data?</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br />Additionally, participants should also consider:</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">- How to automatically and efficiently select proper hyper-parameters?</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">- How to make the solution more generic, i.e., how to make it applicable for unseen tasks?</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">- How to keep the computational and memory cost acceptable? &nbsp;</div>
